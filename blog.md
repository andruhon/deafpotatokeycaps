I'm trying to design keycaps which are good when printed on 
3D printer with AMS or similar material changing system.

## 3 Mar 2025
Decided that it's better to have every symbol in a separate file.
This will help me exporting for 3D printing (with separate file for each material).

## 26 Feb 2025
Moved keycaps from https://github.com/andruhon/34KeysLayoutQMK into this separate repo.

## 23 Feb 2025
Printed first keycaps on P1S with AMS with 0.2mm nozzle. They look really nice!
