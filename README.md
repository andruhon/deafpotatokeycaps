# Super Custom Keycaps

Customizable keycaps with side prints for QMK Tri Layouts opmimized for 3D printing

These keykaps were initially a part of my layout for [TypeS Tri Layout](https://github.com/andruhon/type-s-tri-layout), but it seems like they deserve a separate repo.

Keycaps printed on P1S with AMS, 0.2mm nozzle

## Generating keycaps

Keycaps are at early prototyping stage. I will later organise and document everything properly.
Some insights may be find in [Blog](blog.md)
